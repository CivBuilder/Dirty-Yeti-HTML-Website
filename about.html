        <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Our shop was founded in 2022 by ski bum Chris Catechis, a rider who is passionate about the sport and the culture.</p>
            <p>After years in the tech industry he retired and followed his passions to his next great adventure, Dirty Yeti.</p>

        <h2>Created for riders by riders</h2>
            <p>All are accepted here (except skiers) and the purpose of our shop is to perpetuate the culture and deliver premium gear for our patrons,</p>
            <p>we believe in the gear we sell; we believed in the gear before we believed in our business.</p>
            <p>We do charge extra for shipping as we are committed to ensuring our business is carbon netural, if you aren't about it do business elsewhere.</p>
